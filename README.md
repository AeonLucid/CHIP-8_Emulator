# C# Chip-8_Emulator

This is a [Chip 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator written in C# using OpenTK for graphics.

> **Disclaimer:** This is a project for educational purposes as I'd like to emulate a GBA / SNES and this was a [recommended project](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) for emulation noobs.
